# HTML, advanced

This project is part of the Holberton School Web Development curriculum.  
The objective is to build the full HTML structure of a webpage from a Figma design, focusing strictly on semantic and valid HTML.

In this first project, only HTML is required. No CSS and no JavaScript styling or frameworks should be used.


## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I should be able to explain, without using Google:

- What HTML is and what it is used for
- What a markup language is
- What the DOM (Document Object Model) is
- What an element, a tag, and an attribute are
- How to create an HTML page from a wireframe or a design file
- The purpose of the main HTML tags
- How to structure a webpage using semantic HTML elements such as:
  - `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`
- How to write valid, W3C-compliant HTML
- How to validate code using the W3C Markup Validation Service


## Project Description

The goal of this project is to recreate the HTML structure of a webpage based on a Figma design.  
The work consists of:

- Identifying each logical part of the layout
- Structuring the page using semantic HTML
- Reproducing all text content from the design
- Organizing the page into sections such as header, main content, hero area, services, works, testimonials, footer, and others depending on the design
- Preparing the foundation for future projects where CSS and JavaScript will be added

Only the structure is required. Pixel-perfect spacing, colors, and typography will be implemented in later projects.


## Resources

The following resources are recommended:

- Learn to Code HTML & CSS (up to "Creating Lists")
- Introduction to HTML
- MDN Web Docs – HTML
- Holberton concepts:
  - Some pointers about HTML
  - HTML – Elements of a web page
  - HTML Foundations
  - HTML – Semantic Sectioning Elements
  - HTML Semantic Elements
  - HTML Validation
- W3C Markup Validation Service


## Requirements

- All files must end with a new line
- A `README.md` file is mandatory at the root of the `html_advanced` folder
- No external libraries or frameworks are allowed:
  - No Bootstrap, Tailwind, React, Vue, NodeJS, etc.
- Only pure HTML must be used for this first step
- Code must be valid, semantic, and pass W3C validation
- A Manual QA review must be requested once the project is completed


## Project Structure (expected)

The project will progressively include several HTML files, corresponding to each task:

holbertonschool-web-development/
└── html_advanced/
├── README.md
├── index.html


## Validation

Before submitting, the HTML files must be:

- Tested in a browser
- Checked with the W3C Validator
- Corrected to remove any errors
- Properly indented and easy to read
